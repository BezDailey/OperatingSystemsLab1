# Lab 1: Understanding Fork, Sleep, and Wait in C

## 🎯 Objective:
Dive deep into the usage of the `fork` function in C and how it interacts with `sleep()` and `wait()`. We'll also be looking into the distinctions and implications of using these functions in different scenarios.

## 📋 Instructions:

1. **Fork Fundamentals**: 
   - Use the provided slides as reference.
   - Write a C program demonstrating the use of `fork()`.
   - Explain your code and its output.
   - Provide screenshots of the code execution from your terminal.

2. **Sleep & Fork**: 
   - Illustrate how the `sleep()` function can impact the behavior when using `fork()`.
   - Explain the code and its resulting output.
   - Attach screenshots of the code execution.

3. **Wait vs. Slep in Conjunction with Fork**: 
   - Demonstrate the differences between using `sleep()` and `wait()` functions when paired with `fork()`.
   - Thoroughly explain your code and the output.
   - Supply screenshots of the results.

## 💻 Environment:
Implement your solutions on a Google Cloud VM using VS Code. Ensure you use the terminal pane of VS Code to execute your programs and capture the screenshots.

## ⏳ Submission Guidelines:
- All `.c` files should be submitted separately.
- Ensure that screenshots are clear and capture the necessary output.
